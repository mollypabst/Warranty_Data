This script will show whether or not a sensor is dead and create a report for it

•	If there is a warning in the title that means there are barely any data points so its not very reliable
•	You just have to put the serial number for the sensor in the sensor list, not the MAC address
•	You don’t have to delete the word documents every time you run it, the script will do that for you
